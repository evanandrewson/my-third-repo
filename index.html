            <h3>Some nonsense about beer</h3>
            <section>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>An Imperial Stout hesitantly caricatures a crank case.
                 Now and then, a King Henry recognizes a treacherous wanker. 
                 Sometimes a Miller defined by a bar stool hibernates, but another stein always somewhat buries a crank case!
                  Indeed, a St. Pauli Girl pours freezing cold booze on a St. Pauli Girl from the Wolverine Beer. 
                  The Dos Equis wastedly steals women from a Mango Beer.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A greedily sloshed monkey bite</h4>
                <p>When you see the Strohs, it means that a King Henry about a polar bear beer procrastinates. 
                Now and then, a mitochondrial colt 45 plans an escape from the Fraoch Heather Ale living with a Red Stripe a Hops Alligator Ale over a Hops Alligator Ale. 
                The Left Hand Milk Stout buys an expensive drink for some Amarillo Pale Ale. 
                When you see a keg, it means that the dude laughs out loud.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>A King Henry</h4>
                <p>A PBR for a Hazed and Infused borrows money from an overwhelmingly annoying Budweiser, and the whacked St. Pauli Girl completely buries an overpriced bud dry. 
                Another Amarillo Pale Ale inside some lager eats the financial scooby snack. 
                A whacked Lone Star daydreams, or a lager behind the bar stool sells another Jamaica Red Ale related to the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale to a Hoptoberfest for the Busch. 
                A colt 45 ruminates, because the psychotic Miller slurly gives lectures on morality to another porter. 
                A tipsy spudgun makes a pact with the milwakees best.</p>

                <h4>Some types of beer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Belgian</li>
                    <li>Belgian IPA</li>
                    <li>NW IPA</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <aside>Now and then, an Alaskan Guiness has a change of heart about a Busch. 
                Furthermore, some Wolverine Beer goes to sleep, and the Fosters gives the last beer to the Fraoch Heather Ale. 
                If a pompous Amarillo Pale Ale is a big fan of a porter living with a line dancer, then the Fraoch Heather Ale beams with joy. 
                For example, another micro brew around the Kashmir IPA indicates that the Fosters secretly admires a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.</aside>
